# backrelax

Back Relax is my VR/AR/XR entry for the js13k 2019 game competition.

The code is... not good.

I'm using AFrame for the first time, and <i>really</i> struggling with dynamic components. I'm tired, though, and I don't want to do more on it.

I apologize to anybody hoping to learn from my code: don't. :)

As for the actual value of this app, well, it hasn't been reviewed by any medical professionals, and is not approved by the FDA.

Here, however, are some links about how VR has proven helpful for some individuals' pain relief:
